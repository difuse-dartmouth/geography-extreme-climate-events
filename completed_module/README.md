This repository contains all the components of the data science module for Dartmouth College's Geography 36: Climate Extremes in a Warming Planet.  Use the button on the upper right next to the course title to download the entire module.

## Primary Objective

The problem sets were designed to introduce students to important concepts/applications in Python and to connect the lecture content. In order to keep the problem sets simple and not overwhelm the students, the problem sets were broken up into five separate, shorter assignments. The contents of the problem sets are outlined below to indicate after which lectures the problem sets should be introduced. 

## Student Expectations

This course has no prerequisites and satisfies a "Science" distributive requirement.  Consequently, students from all class years take the course and their mathematical and programming backgrounds are heterogeneous.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Demystify scientific computing and programming using Python
2.	Recognize commonly used data in climate science
3.	Apply Python computing methods to climate data
4.	Interpret results generated from scientific computing
