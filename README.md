# Module Overview
## Module Objective 
The problem sets were designed to introduce students to important concepts/applications in Python and to connect the lecture content. In order to keep the problem sets simple and not overwhelm the students, the problem sets were broken up into five separate, shorter assignments. The contents of the problem sets are outlined below to indicate after which lectures the problem sets should be introduced.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Demystify scientific computing and programming using Python
2. Recognize commonly used data in climate science
3. Apply Python computing methods to climate data
4. Interpret results generated from scientific computing

## Module Description
Students code in python to facilitate analysis and understanding of climate data sets that relate to extreme events. Before this module, the course had a series of python tutorials for students but the examples were not related to the course. This module redesigned the python notebooks to teach coding through manipulation and analysis of climate data sets, linking to course topics as the term progressed.

### Data
The module uses a variety of data including NAO/AO, disaster numbers, wave height, latent heat, flood return periods, net radiation, heat waves, surface pressure.

### Platform
Python notebooks using Google CoLab.

## Course Information

This module was created for a geography course, <a href="https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Geography/GEOG-Geography/GEOG-36">Climate Extremes on a Warming Planet, at Dartmouth College.  The course looks at drought, famine, floods, landslides and other extreme weather events through the lens of climate change. This course has no prerequisites and satisfies a "Science" distributive requirement. Consequently, students from all class years take the course and their mathematical and programming backgrounds are heterogeneous.
